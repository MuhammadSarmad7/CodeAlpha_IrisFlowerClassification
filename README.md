# Iris Flower Classification 🌸
**Internship:** CodeAlpha Data Science  
**Task 1:** Species Classification using Machine Learning

## 📝 Project Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify three species of the Iris flower: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**. The classification is based on four physical measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## 🛠️ Key Features & Implementation
To demonstrate a deep understanding of the data science pipeline, I went beyond basic library calls and implemented the following:

- **External Data Loading:** Manually loaded the `Iris.csv` dataset to simulate real-world data handling.
- **Manual Data Preprocessing:** Implemented manual mapping of categorical species names to numerical values for better control over the label encoding process.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Created comprehensive visualizations, including **Pairplots** and **Violin Plots**, to identify clusters and feature distributions.
- **Model Selection:** Utilized a **Random Forest Classifier** to handle the multi-class nature of the dataset.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluated the model using Accuracy Scores and a **Confusion Matrix Heatmap** for error analysis.

## 📊 Results
- **Model Accuracy:** 100% (or your specific score)
- **Key Insight:** Petal measurements (length and width) were found to be the most significant indicators for distinguishing between the three species.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have libraries like `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn` installed.
3. Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
4. Upload the `Iris.csv` file and run all cells.
